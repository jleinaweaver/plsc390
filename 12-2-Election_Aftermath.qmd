Political science is awesome!

- AND, the models we develop can be incredibly powerful!

<br>

Biden currently at 38% or 39% which per this model predicts 46-ish% of the vote which is close to Harris's predicted total

<br>

Want to get fancier?

- Every four years the journal PS solicits election forecasts from experts in political science. 

- This year they took the state-level forecasts from five different teams of political scientists to predict the EC outcome

- SLIDE

BOOM!

"Every governing party facing election in a developed country this year lost vote share"

- The Covid pandemic plus the inflation IT caused has devastated governing parties in democracies around the world

- Full credit to the Harris campaign for doing as well as they did given these headwinds against them
