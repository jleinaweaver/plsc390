Prep for Class

1. Bring a marker

<br>

**So, what have we missed in post-election news?**

- **What's going on in the world?**

<br>

Today I'd like us to wrap up our work from the semester

- e.g. see where you ended up on the key concepts, on evaluating American democracy and then make a few predictions

::: notes

We focused the first section of the class on the contested concept that is democracy.

<br>

Help me make a list of the key criteria in your definition of democracy

- **So, where did you end up on "democracy"?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**Which of these criteria do you all include and which not?**

<br>

**Can we rank these in terms of importance or are all of them necessary simultaneously?**

**Per these criteria, is America a democracy? e.g. as a dichotomous measure, yes or no?**

- **Why or why not?**

<br>

**Per these criteria, is America a "good" democracy? e.g. as a level of democracy**

- **Why or why not?**

**Contemporary Threats to American Democracy**

- Misinformation

- Issue Polarization

- Affective Polarization

:::

::: notes

In the second half of our semester we shifted our focus to the cutting edge of political science research on new threats to American democracy.

<br>

**Which of these is the most serious threat to our country? Why?**

<br>

Each of you are focusing your final papers on one, or more, of these problems.

- Let's go around the room and hear each of your "calls to action"!

- **So, which problem are you targeting and what do you want me, the reader of your op-ed, to do about it?**

## Predicting Our Future: 2025 - 2028 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_color.png" .center}

::: notes

I want to hear your predictions for the next four years!

- *ON BOARD*

- Classify each as high vs low confidence

<br>

SLIDE: Final paper

:::






## The Final Paper {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

What is one specific policy we could implement at the local, state or national level that would reduce the levels of misinformation, polarization or affective polarization in American society?

Make your argument in the style of an **op-ed of no more than 800 words (excluding the bibliography)** that you could submit to a newspaper or website interested in thoughtful, well researched analyses of the world we live in.

**Questions on the final paper prompt or expected style?**
