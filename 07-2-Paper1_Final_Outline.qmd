Prep for Class

1. Check Canvas submissions

<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

:::



## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

The target of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

**Questions on the assignment?**

## Revised Outlines {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/07_1-ASSIGN.png)

::: notes

For today I asked everyone to revise their outlines to add:

1. Critical analysis, and 

2. To produce three visualizations you will use in your report

<br>

**Does everybody have the critical analysis components added explicitly in their outlines?**

- **e.g. covers all four data projects and deeply analyzes each premise?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's now talk about the visualizations

:::



## Professional visualizations include... {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1.1, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Figure 1. A count of countries by regional grouping taken from the national statistics of the United Nations (2009-2011) that shows the great majority of countries in the world are located in Africa and Asia."}
# The labs() function
library(carData)

ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "x Axis Label", y = "y Axis Label", 
       title = "A title like a thesis statement for the visualization")

# caption = "Source: Where did the data come from?"
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Informative titles,

2. Clear axis labels, and

3. A figure caption with

    - Data sources
    
    - Description, and
    
    - Conclusions

A refresher from Data Analysis class (or a preview?)

<br>

Any visualizations you produce for other people to consume must be polished for a professional audience!

- As a baseline that requires these three elements!

<br>

**Any questions on these requirements?**

<br>

Everybody take some time to polish their visualizations

- Make sure each one includes these elements

- Go!

Ok, pair off (new partners!) and share revised outlines!

- Get and give feedback THEN get to work writing the paper!
