Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Readings
    - Diamond, L. (1999). Defining and Developing Democracy. In R. A. Dahl, I. Shapiro, & J. A. Cheibub (Eds.), The Democracy Sourcebook (pp. 1â€“23). MIT Press.

<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

## Democracy as a Contested Concept {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.fragment}
"So serious is the conceptual disarray that more than 500 subtypes of democracy are identified in in [Collier and Levitsky's] review of some 150 (mostly recent) studies" (Diamond 1999, 7).

::: notes

Aim for today: Explore the concept of democracy while also refreshing our memories on the challenges of measurement

<br>

The first big thing I want you to take from the Diamond (1999) reading is this:

- REVEAL: As of a lit review 25 years ago there were something like 550 versions of democracy identifiable in the academic literature!

- That's astounding!

<br>

The good news is that in these cases, because it is scientific literature, these definitions are being clearly stated, explained and defended!

- That is NOT a standard being met in the course of normal political debate covered by the news!

<br>

Alright, let's dig into the concept!

- *Split class into groups of 3 (if possible), but no more than groups of 4*

- Go sit with your groups!

## Defining and Measuring Democracy {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-Measurement.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

In order to explore the contested nature of democracy as a research exercise, I am going to ask each group to create a new measure of democracy

<br>

Measurement begins with a concept and a definition

- Your reading for today and your life experiences thus far gives you plenty of material to draw from

- The pre-class Canvas assignment hopefully forced you to select a few broad principles you believe are necessary for defining democracy

<br>

I will now ask each group to translate these lists of principles into a concrete measurement tool

- e.g. an instrument for measuring democracy

<br>

### Create a nominal measure of democracy

::: notes

Of all the levels of measurement, nominal is typically the simplest

<br>

**Can anybody define a nominal measurement for us?**

- (Nominal measures represent the world using simple names for the characteristic we are interested in; not in any particular order)

<br>

**Examples of nominal measures?**

- (Party ID: Rep, Dem, Ind)

- (Gender: Male, Female, Nonbinary, etc)

- (City of birth)

<br>

So, I am asking for an instrument that we can use to classify any country in the world as either a democracy or not

- **Big picture, does that make sense?**

:::

<br>

### Create a nominal measure of democracy

- A list of *necessary criteria* that must be present to classify a country as a democracy

::: notes

In practical terms, think of this like converting your chosen list of democratic principles into a list of *necessary* criteria

- In general, a *necessary* criteria is one that must be present in order for another condition to occur

- So, in essence, I want each group to make a list of necessary criteria for democracy.

- If a country has all of these conditions then your group would classify it as a democracy

<br>

**Make sense? Questions on the assignment?**

- Get to it! 

- *When completed have them put them ON BOARD*

<br>

GROUPS, present your nominal measure of democracy in the context of the Diamond (1999) reading

- In other words, does your list lean more towards "electoral democracy", "liberal democracy" or something else? Why?
    - both defined p10-11
    
<br>

**How difficult was this exercise?**

- **What were the hardest and easiest parts?**

<br>

**How confident would you be in using this instrument to classify all the countries currently in the world?**

- **Do you believe this instrument would produce valid and reliable measures? Why or why not?**

- Valid: Are you capturing the actual concept you are aiming for?
- Reliable: Would different users of your instrument focused on the same case produce the same results?

<br>

A very good start to the exercise, but I'm afraid these measures don't allow us to explore the variation that actually exists in the world

- SLIDE: So, let's move up the ladder of measurement!

<br>

### Create an ordinal measure of democracy

::: notes

**Can anybody define an ordinal measurement for us?**

- (Similar to nominal, e.g. named levels, BUT the order of the levels now has meaning)

- (In other words, the values stress the order or rank of the values, but the differences between each one is not really known.)

<br>

**Examples of ordinal measures?**

- (Class standing in college: FR, SO, JR, SR)

- (Socioeconomic class: Lower, middle, upper)

- (Likert scale measures: Strongly disagree; Disagree; Neither agree nor disagree; Agree; Strongly agree)

<br>

So, I am now asking for an instrument that we can use to classify any country in the world by how much democracy it has

- **Big picture, does that make sense?**

:::



## Measuring Democracy {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

<br>

### Create an ordinal measure of democracy

1. "No democracy at all"
2. "Very little democracy"
3. "Some democracy"
4. "A great deal of democracy"

::: notes

In specific terms, let's design a measure that produces classifications across these four levels

- **Questions on the task?**

- Go!

- *When completed have them put them ON BOARD*

<br>

GROUPS, present your ordinal measure of democracy

<br>

**In what ways was this harder and in what ways was it easier than designing the nominal measure?**

<br>

**How confident would you be in using this instrument to classify all the countries currently in the world?**

- **Do you believe this instrument would produce valid and reliable measures? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Bottom line, how hard is it to produce ANY measure of democracy?**
