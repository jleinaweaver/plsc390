::: notes

The Grumbach paper represents an ambitious attempt to both:

1. Measure the quality of American democracy at the state level, AND

2. Explain the observed variation in American democracy over time.

<br>

Grumbach is transparent in his methodology and provides access to all of it to any researcher who wants to audit his work or re-examine the question

- SO, let's get hands on with the data!

:::

### Grumbach2022_state_democracy_index.xlsx

- Analyze the variation in state scores on the State Democracy Index (`democracy_mcmc`) in 2018

::: notes

Let's start in the most recent year available (2018)

- Don't focus on individual states yet, we want to analyze the spread first

<br>

Work with the people around you to analyze the level of democracy across the US states in 2018?

- What's the average score?

- What's the median score?

- What's the spread look like?

<br>

SLIDE: Discussion and histogram

:::

Summary stats

```

Standard deviation: `r sd(d_index$democracy_mcmc[d_index$year == 2018])`

<br>

Now I want you to focus on the states themselves

- Sort the states by their 2018 score and get ready to talk to me about democracy in specific cases across the country

SLIDE: Let's now color the states by party control

  mutate(
    party = case_when(
      partycontrolpost2014 == 0 ~ "Republicans",
      partycontrolpost2014 == 1 ~ "Divided Government",
      partycontrolpost2014 == 2 ~ "Democrats"

  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), legend.position=c(.2,.75)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "grey", "red"))
```

::: notes

Clearly an association here

- **But what would it take to convince you that this is a causal relationship?**

<br>

**Does Grumbach's model do it? Why or why not?**

- Wealthy GOP elite incentivized to restrict the electorate away from those with different "class interests"

- GOP base incentivized to restrict the electorate to protect their racial and partisan identity

- Different reasons, but both push to restrict democracy

<br>

Ok, next challenge!

- How have these scores and this distribution changed since 2000?

- Compare these results to the spread and scores in 2000 and report back to me the differences

<br>

### Grumbach2022_state_democracy_index.xlsx

- Make a line plot of Missouri's scores on the State Democracy Index (`democracy_mcmc`)

::: notes

`democracy_mcmc` is the variable name for the State Democracy Index created in the paper

- Remember, these scores are the results of a factor analysis run on 51 indicators of democracy.

- Let's visualize Missouri!

       title = "Missouri's democracy was on the weak side of American states and it is declining over time!",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)")

# # Descriptive stats
# mo_2000 <- d_mo_index$democracy_mcmc[d_mo_index$year == 2000]
# 
# quantile(d_index$democracy_mcmc[d_index$year == 2000], probs = c(.204))
# 
# mo_2018 <- d_mo_index$democracy_mcmc[d_mo_index$year == 2018]
# 
# quantile(d_index$democracy_mcmc[d_index$year == 2018], probs = c(.06))

```

::: notes

In 2000, MO had a negative democracy score AND was only in the 20th percentile of US states by health of American democracy

- 40 states had a better democracy score!

<br>

In 2018, MO's score drops to -2 which is the 6th percentile!

- 47 states have a better democracy score than us

- Thanks to Tennessee, North Carolina and Wisconsin for sucking just slightly more than we do!

<br>

SLIDE: Add some context!

::: notes

I gotta be honest, my gut intuition had been that Kansas, Oklahoma and Alabama would be way lower

- But that's the value of data over intuitions!

- On the other hand, I wouldn't exactly celebrate a score in the negative digits so maybe my intuitions aren't that far off

<br>

SLIDE: Alright, let's unpack that Missouri score

### Grumbach2022-Input_Data.xlsx

### Grumbach2022-Variables_list.xlsx

::: notes

Let's now shift our focus to the input variables

- e.g. the 51 indicators that Grumbach uses to construct his state democracy index.

<br>

**Which variables do we want to dig into? Help me make a list!**

- *List on board*

- *Divy out to small groups*

<br>

Ok groups, dig into your assigned variable for 2018

- What do we learn about the states from analyzing your variable?

- Get ready to report back!

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*
