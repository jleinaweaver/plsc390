![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023-Header.png)

::: notes

The Grumbach paper represents an ambitious attempt to both:

1. Measure the quality of American democracy at the state level, AND

2. Explain the observed variation in American democracy over time.

<br>

Grumbach is transparent in his methodology and provides access to all of it to any researcher who wants to audit his work or re-examine the question

- SO, let's get hands on with the data!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Grumbach2022_Main_Dataset_Combined.xlsx

- Analyze the variation in state scores on the State Democracy Index (`democracy_mcmc`) in 2018

::: notes

Let's start in the most recent year available (2018)

- Don't focus on individual states yet, we want to analyze the spread first

<br>

Work with the people around you to analyze the level of democracy across the US states in 2018?

- What's the average score?

- What's the median score?

- What's the spread look like?

<br>

SLIDE: Discussion and histogram

:::



## The State Democracy Index: Variation {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.asp=.7, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}

Summary stats

```{r}
summary(d_index_2018$democracy_mcmc)
```

Standard deviation: `r sd(d_index_2018$democracy_mcmc)`

<br>

Now I want you to focus on the states themselves

- Sort the states by their 2018 score and get ready to talk to me about democracy in specific cases across the country

- (SLIDE: Version on 2018 by state)

```

::: notes

Let's now look at the states themselves

- **What do we take from this? Any surprises?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's now color the states by party control

:::



## The State Democracy Index: Cases {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.asp=.85, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.width=9}

  labs(x = "The State Democracy Index in 2018", y = "",
       title = "Unified Republican control is associated with lower democracy scores",
       color = "",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), legend.position=c(.2,.75)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "grey", "red"))
```

::: notes

Clearly an association here

- **But what would it take to convince you that this is a causal relationship?**

<br>

**Does Grumbach's model do it? Why or why not?**

- Wealthy GOP elite incentivized to restrict the electorate away from those with different "class interests"

- GOP base incentivized to restrict the electorate to protect their racial and partisan identity

- Different reasons, but both push to restrict democracy

<br>

Ok, next challenge!

- SLIDE: Let's re-examine this relationship but across time

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

### What is the average score of `democracy_mcmc` for each type of party control?

- e.g. unified democrat, divided and unified republican governments

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
d |>
  filter(!is.na(party)) |>
  group_by(party) |>
  summarize(
    Avg = mean(democracy_mcmc),
    Median = median(democracy_mcmc)
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(digits = 3)
```
:::

::: notes

Group the data by party in control (not by state)

<br>

REVEAL: **What does this imply is true across the whole dataset?**

<br>

Strong correlation, but causality could still run either way!

- Averages are also not the most precise tool for comparison

<br>

SLIDE: Let's redo the analysis for every year in the dataset

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

### What is the average score of `democracy_mcmc` by party and by year?

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618}
d |>
  filter(!is.na(party)) |>
  group_by(year, party) |>
  summarize(
    Avg = mean(democracy_mcmc)
  ) |>
#  pivot_wider(names_from = party, values_from = Avg) 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Avg, color = party)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Mean State Democracy Index Score", color = "",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1.5, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2018, 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkgrey", "blue", "red")) +
  #guides(color = "none")
  theme(legend.position=c(.2,.2))

```

::: notes

**What do we learn from this per year analysis?**

- **Have we addressed the correlation not causation problem here?**

<br>

Not yet!

- Now we have correlations per year

- This evidence is still consistent with a story that states with weaker democratic institutions are more likely to elect Republicans.

<br>

SLIDE: Let's add a one year lag!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

### Let's recheck the averages with a one year lag

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618}
d |>
  arrange(state, year) |>
  mutate(
    partycontrol2 = lag(partycontrol, n = 1)
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(partycontrol2)) |>
  group_by(year, partycontrol2) |>
  summarize(
    Avg = mean(democracy_mcmc)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    party = case_when(
      partycontrol2 == 0 ~ "Unified Republican",
      partycontrol2 == 1 ~ "Divided Government",
      partycontrol2 == 2 ~ "Unified Democratic"
    )
  ) |>
#  pivot_wider(names_from = party, values_from = Avg) 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Avg, color = party)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Mean State Democracy Index Score", color = "",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)",
       title = "Analyzing changes in democracy on a one year time lag") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1.5, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2018, 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkgrey", "blue", "red")) +
  #guides(color = "none")
  theme(legend.position=c(.2,.2))

```

::: notes

This plot redoes our analysis but with a time lag

- e.g. does party control this year correlate with average levels of democracy next year?

<br>

**What do we see in this?**

- **Is this more convincing? Why or why not?**

<br>

SLIDE: What about changes rather than overall averages?

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

### Do changes in party control predict changes in democracy one year later?

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618}
# Find the cases with a change in party control then record the change in democracy
# 112 cases
d_changes <- d |>
  arrange(state, year) |>
  group_by(state) |>
  mutate(
    last_party = lag(party, n = 1),
    change_party = if_else(lag(party, n = 1) != party, 1, 0),
    change_democ = lead(democracy_mcmc, n = 1) - democracy_mcmc
  ) |>
  select(state, year, last_party, party, change_party, democracy_mcmc, change_democ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(change_party == 1)

d_changes |>
  select(state, year, last_party, party, change_democ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = party, y = change_democ)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("blue3", "grey", "red4"), outliers = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Unified Democratic", "Divided Government", "Unified Republican")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Change in Democracy Index (1 Year)",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)")
```

::: notes

For these box plots I've focused in on only those cases in the dataset where the party control variable changed

- e.g. the state moved from democratic to divided or divided to republican or the other direction

- I am then plotting the change in democracy score the year after this change in party control

<br>

**Remind me, how do we read a box plot?**

<br>

**And how do we read these specific box plots?**

<br>

SLIDE: Turns out there are some outliers my plot is ignoring...

### Do changes in party control predict changes in democracy one year later?

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618}
# Flag the outliers
out1 <- d_changes |>
  filter(change_democ < -1.5)

d_changes |>
  select(state, year, last_party, party, change_democ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = party, y = change_democ)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("blue3", "grey", "red4"), outliers = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Unified Democratic", "Divided Government", "Unified Republican")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Change in Democracy Index (1 Year)",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)") +
    ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = out1, aes(label = state), size = 3)
```

::: notes

There are five cases where the new unified republican government reduced the quality of the state's democracy by so much as to be outside the usual box plot constraints

- e.g. 1.5 x the width of the IQR

<br>

Note: NC went from unified democratic control to divided government in 2011

<br>

**Does this change anything for us?**

- The story is much worse

<br>

**Are we getting closer to a causal argument here?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's track some states!

### Grumbach2022_state_democracy_index.xlsx

- Make a line plot of Missouri's scores on the State Democracy Index (`democracy_mcmc`)

::: notes

`democracy_mcmc` is the variable name for the State Democracy Index created in the paper

- Remember, these scores are the results of a factor analysis run on 51 indicators of democracy.

- Let's visualize Missouri!

:::

  labs(x = "", y = "Democracy Score", 
       title = "Missouri's democracy was on the weak side of American states and it is declining over time!",
       caption = "Source: Grumbach (2023)")

# # Descriptive stats
# mo_2000 <- d_mo_index$democracy_mcmc[d_mo_index$year == 2000]
# 
# quantile(d_index$democracy_mcmc[d_index$year == 2000], probs = c(.204))
# 
# mo_2018 <- d_mo_index$democracy_mcmc[d_mo_index$year == 2018]
# 
# quantile(d_index$democracy_mcmc[d_index$year == 2018], probs = c(.06))

```

::: notes

In 2000, MO had a negative democracy score AND was only in the 20th percentile of US states by health of American democracy

- 40 states had a better democracy score!

<br>

In 2018, MO's score drops to -2 which is the 6th percentile!

- 47 states have a better democracy score than us

- Thanks to Tennessee, North Carolina and Wisconsin for sucking just slightly more than we do!

<br>

SLIDE: Add some context!

::: notes

I gotta be honest, my gut intuition had been that Kansas, Oklahoma and Alabama would be way lower

- But that's the value of data over intuitions!

- On the other hand, I wouldn't exactly celebrate a score in the negative digits so maybe my intuitions aren't that far off

<br>
