Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions
    - Repetition and Misinformation: Find us an example from the ongoing election dynamics of someone using repetition to spread misinformation. Provide the APA citation and explain your example.

2. Readings
    - Gordon Pennycook, Tyrone D. Cannon, and David G. Rand (2018). “Prior exposure increases perceived accuracy of fake news.” Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 147(12): 1865–1880.
    
<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

## The Threat of Misinformation {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. How big is the threat?

2. How serious is the threat?

Last week we began exploring our first big contemporary problem: Misinformation

<br>

**What were your takeaways from our work last week?**

<br>

- Challenges to measuring misinformation?

- Challenges to identifying misinformation in the American public?

- Possible impacts of misinformation: 1. Erosion of Civil Discourse, 2. Political Paralysis, 3. Alienation and Disengagement, 4. Policy Uncertainty

<br>

Our work for this week is to explore the academic literature that aims to explain how misinformation works

- We need theories!

<br>

Our plan for today is to explore the research article and then use it as a jumping off point to discuss the examples you submitted to Canvas

**Kick us off with, what is the research question this article attempts to answer?**

- (RQ: How do people come to believe stories that are patently and demonstrably untrue? (1866))

<br>

**Do these researchers make an effective argument that this is an important question? How specifically?**

- (Nice opening section on why we should care about misinformation)

<br>

**Ok, what is the big, terrifying central conclusion of this research paper?**

- **What is the "illusory truth effect"?**

- (SLIDE)

::: notes

The key causal mechanism being studied here is called the "illusory truth effect"

- In short, frequently repeated lies come to sound like truth over time

<br>

More technically, this effect is scary because it abuses two very useful aspects of your learning

<br>

FIRST, your brain is designed to adapt to the messages you hear the most frequently

- In other words, you are wired to develop fluency in the messages you hear the most often
    
- This is why it is easier to learn a foreign language in the country that uses that language

- Being surrounded by the language rewires your brain more quickly

<br>

SECOND, your brain tends to assume that the messages you are fluent in are useful 

- e.g. Fluency serves as a heuristic device to infer accuracy (p1866)

<br>

In other words, hearing a lie repeated over and over rewires your brain to recognize the idea, AND

- The easier it is for you to recognize an idea, the more likely you are to assume it is true!

<br>

IMO this is a terrifying conclusion and a serious concern for those of us worried about the health of our democracy

<br>

The aim of this paper is to test two boundary conditions for this effect

1. Does extreme implausibility stop you from believing repeated lies?

2. Does the motivated reasoning of partisanship prevent the illusory truth effect?

<br>

SLIDE: Let's examine the experiments!

**Study 1: Extreme Implausibility Boundary Condition**

- p1867-1868
:::

::: notes

**Ok, what do we learn from their first experiment?**

- **What do they conclude and are you convinced by what they did? Why or why not?**

<br>

- Final sample size of 409
    - excluding 51 dropping out, 50 admitting they answered randomly, 24 searched online for info, 32 didn't complete the two parts
    
- SLIDE: "Facts" on next slide
    - 4 implausible lies, 4 known truths and 20 items sampled from list of "largely unknown facts"
    
- Surveying Procedure
    1. Half of items ("facts") presented in "familiarization stage" where respondents asked to rate the "interestingness" of each fact on a 1-6 scale; means some of the "facts" have been heard or considered before being evaluated
    2. 2 minutes of "filler" questions, e.g. demographics
    3. Accuracy portion: "assess the accuracy of the statements on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (definitely false) to 6 (definitely true)"
    4. Questions to check quality of responses (did you google anything? did you answer randomly? etc)

- Results two slides away

::: notes

**Questions on reading the results in Table 2?**

<br>

- Accuracy questions 1-6 scale (from "definitely false" to "definitely true")

- Idea here is to compare the group means

- Is there a difference in level of perceived accuracy between "facts" respondent hears for the first time ("Novel") vs those they already considered as interesting or not at the beginning of the survey ("Familiarized")?

<br>

Start with the "known facts"

- e.g. the obviously true (there are > 50 stars in the universe) and the obviously false (Earth is not a perfect square)

- Essentially there is NO DIFFERENCE in accuracy ratings between new and repeated facts

<br>

BUT, when the "facts" are unknown the simple act of repetition increased perceived accuracy!

<br>

**Takeaways for us?**

<br>

Scary!

- And this was a SUPER mild treatment!

- It's not like the respondents have been hearing the lies repeated ad nauseum for years, just introduced to them a few minutes prior as interesting or not

**Study 2: Fake News**

![](Images/11_1-Pennycook-TableA3A4.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**What do you think of the "fake news" definition employed in the paper?**

- ("Fake news" defined (p1865): "...news stories that were fabricated (but presented as if from legitimate sources) and promoted on social media to deceive the public for ideological and/or financial gain (Lazer et al., 2018).")

<br>

**Good examples of this here? Why or why not?**

<br>

Process this time mirrors the first but three-stage experiment with a few tweaks (1869)

**Study 2: Fake News**

![](Images/11_1-Pennycook-Figure2.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Ok, what do we learn from their second experiment?**

- **What do they conclude and are you convinced by what they did? Why or why not?**

<br>

Figure 2, Panel B

- Note how the distribution of accuracy evaluations flattens for "familiar" "facts"

- The shift to the right (more perceived accuracy) is unmistakable

<br>

Figure 2, Panel A

- Flagging the "lies" by fact checkers DIDN'T help!

- Flagged lies got lower scores overall BUT the difference remains

- The illusory truth effect in practice!

<br>

**Takeaways for us?**

<br>

A SINGLE prior exposure boosts perceived accuracy for both fake and real news.  

- This works even if a) the fake news is flagged (fact checking), b) the news conflicts with your partisan view of the world, and c) when focused on stories perceived as unknown during the “familiarity stage” of the experiment.

**Study 2: Fake News**

![](Images/11_1-Pennycook-Table3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Tougher table to disentangle but the key here is that the difference between "familiar" and "novel" "facts" is significant in all conditions

- Just hearing about a "fact" prepares you to believe it!

**Study 3: Fake News, 1-Week Interval**

![](Images/11_1-Pennycook-Figure3.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Last study before we bring this into our discussion of the election

- **What is the takeaway from experiment three?**

<br>

The effect of repetition **persists** over time (1 week later), AND **increases** with additional repetition of the treatment

- Small effect after the first repetition (EXPLORE THIS IN CLASS)  

- Scary that this effect works even when we aren’t aware of the exposure! Suggests that this fluency effect is powerful and may be subconscious  

- The effect is NOT countered by by motivated reasoning  

- Fact checking may help BUT it does not outweigh the effect of the repetition

<br>

Ok, connect these dots for me to the cases you submitted to Canvas for today

- **Who has an example of these dynamics at play in the current election?**

<br>

Bottom-line:

1. **How much trouble are we in?**
    - **How susceptible are you to this illusory truth effect?**

2. **What can we do to protect ourselves?**

3. **Is being concerned about the spread of misinformation a partisan issue or not?**
