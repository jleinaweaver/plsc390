**Takeaways from the research we analyzed last class?**

<br>

- The key causal mechanism: the "illusory truth effect"

- When the "facts" are unknown the simple act of repetition increased perceived accuracy!

- A SINGLE prior exposure boosts perceived accuracy for both fake and real news.  

    - This works even if a) the fake news is flagged (fact checking), b) the news conflicts with your partisan view of the world, and c) when focused on stories perceived as unknown during the “familiarity stage” of the experiment.
    
- The effect of repetition **persists** over time (1 week later), AND **increases** with additional repetition of the treatment

<br>

So, our brains appear to be hard wired for believing lies if they get repeated enough

- SLIDE: Today, let's add another reason we're in trouble - overconfidence!

**What are the big picture conclusions of this research article?**

<br>

Our results paint a worrying picture (p1)

1. The vast majority of respondents (about 90%) reported that they are above average in their ability to discern false and legitimate news headlines, meaning that many Americans substantially overestimate their abilities. 

2. Further, using data measuring respondents’ online behavior, we show that those who overrate their ability more frequently visit websites known to spread false or misleading news.

3. These overconfident respondents are also less able to distinguish between true and false claims about current events and report higher willingness to share false content, especially when it aligns with their political predispositions.

<br>

So:

- Almost everyone overrates their ability to detect fake news,

- Those worst at detecting fake news tend to use the worst sources for daily news consumption, AND

- Those worst at detecting fake news are also most willing to share fake news with others

<br>

Let's start by unpacking the key causal mechanism in the paper

- **What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect?**

- (SLIDE: version 1)

<br>

*Notes*

RQ: How pervasive is overconfidence? Is overconfidence related to false news exposure? Are overconfident individuals actually more likely to hold misperceptions or share false stories?

1. To what extent will people who are least accurate at distinguishing between legitimate and false news overrate their ability to distinguish mainstream from false news?

2. Is overconfidence in one’s ability to distinguish mainstream from false news positively related to false news exposure?

3. (1) Is overconfidence positively related to holding misperceptions on specific topics? (2) Is this relationship stronger when the claim is politically congenial?

4. (1) Is overconfidence positively related to self-reported willingness to like or share false content? (2) Is this relationship stronger when the claim is politically congenial?

**The Dunning-Kruger Effect**
:::

::: notes

Here is the sort-of intuitive level version of the Dunning-Kruger effect

- **Have you all seen this or something like it before?**

<br>

I like to think that across our semester in this class we've tracked this dynamic pretty closely in our studies of the democracy concept

<br>

Think about the stories we tell our kids as they grow up in this country

- America is the longest surviving, most impressive democracy in history

- Our founding fathers were super-geniuses that designed a system so perfect we were destined to become the richest and most powerful country in the world

- We want to push kids off the "huh?" and socialize them to appreciate the shared values that unite us as Americans

<br>

Over time you get exposed to deeper more detailed histories of our founding and track the evolution of rights in our system and I'm guessing you inevitably start to come down this slope

<br>

Then you get to my class and we race to the bottom of this valley (and hopefully start moving up the other side)!

- The goal is NOT to reach a sense of certainty!

- The goal is to deepen your understanding of the topic in all its complexity

- Expertise means knowing how many assumptions it takes to adopt any single definition of democracy!

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

SLIDE: A more standard version of the DKE

This is the standard style of visual presentation of this "effect"

- The "peak of Mt Stupid" makes me laugh everytime I see it

- And the "valley of despair" is the absolute best way to describe graduate school I've ever heard

<br>

**How does the Dunning-Kruger Effect motivate Lyons, Montgomery, Guess & Reifler's research into the problem of overconfidence?**

<br>

Poor performers in social and intellectual domains tend to be unaware of their own deficiency whereas competent performers slightly underestimate their own ability relative to others

<br>

Even more concerning, poor performers suffer from **a double bind**:

1. A lack of expertise produces errors, AND

2. A lack of expertise prevents recognition of these errors and awareness of others’ capabilities.

<br>

**How do the authors connect the DKE and the spread of fake news?**

- **What are the key assumptions being made here?**

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Lyons, Montgomery, Guess & Reifler (2021): Theory**
:::

- Respondents ability to discern fake news tracks the DKE (least discerning = most overconfident)

::: {.fragment}
- Overconfident respondents:

    - Can't identify misinformation
    
    - Don't realize they lack the tools to discern misinformation
    
    - Experience "invulnerability bias"
    
    - Are more willing to accept and spread false claims (less reflection)
    
    - Are especially vulnerable to motivated reasoning (confirming political priors)

:::
::: notes

1. Overconfidence should be associated with visits to "false news websites"
    
    - DKE means the overconfident person can't identify the misinformation they are being fed, AND
    
    - Don't realize they can't tell the difference between true and false news

2. Overconfidence as "invulnerability bias"

    - assumed mastery leads people to feel little need to take preventative actions (e.g., to be cautious or engage in deliberate thinking about which sites one visits), which may produce additional exposure to questionable media messages (28, 29).

3. Overconfidence associated with less reflection.

    - May be more willing to accept false claims and to engage with false content in the form of liking or sharing these stories

4. Effect most pronounced when the fake news is consistent with their own prior political beliefs

<br>

**What do we think of this as a model of political behavior? Strengths and weaknesses?**

**Overall, does the evidence show this is a useful model of behavior?**

3. The overconfident

    - Visit more "false news websites"
    
    - Are more willing to share false headlines
    
    - Are less able to to discern between true and false statements
    
    - Are particularly susceptible to congenial false news
:::
::: notes

The conclusions in this paper are quite stark and are directly in line with the model! (p7)

- We find that respondents tend to think they are better than the average person at news discernment, and perceived ability is only weakly associated with actual ability, with the worst performers also being the most overconfident. 

- Importantly, overconfidence is associated with a range of normatively troubling outcomes, including visits to false news websites in online behavior data. 

- The overconfident also express greater willingness to share false headlines and are less able to discern between true and false statements about contemporaneous news events. 

- Notably, the overconfident are particularly susceptible to congenial false news. These results suggest that overconfidence may be a crucial factor for explaining how false and low-quality information spreads via social media.

<br>

What I'd like us to do is focus on the uncertainty in these conclusions

- Focusing on the "Materials and Methods" section in the main article and the supplementary appendix I posted on Canvas I want you to help me critically analyze this piece of research

- **How convinced are you by these conclusions given the design and execution of these survey exercises?**

- Discuss in groups and get ready to report back!

**What is our takeaway from this research?**

- **If this is the world we live in, what do we do about it?**

<br>

- "Targeting these overconfident individuals could be an important step toward reducing misinformation on social media sites, though how best to do so remains an open question."

- "Most critically, our analyses are correlational and, thus, face concerns about endogeneity. ... For instance, habitual exposure to false news might lead to poorly calibrated estimates of one’s ability to detect it, especially given the tendency for people to treat incoming information as true and the subsequent effects this can have on feelings of fluency (54). Overconfidence and false news engagement could even mutually reinforce one another over time (55)."

- Michael Barthel, Amy Mitchell and Jesse Holcomb (2016). “Many Americans Believe Fake News Is Sowing Confusion.” Pew Research Center, December 15, 2016.

- The Pew Report is very accessible and paints a picture of Americans suspicious of fake news and way too confident in their own ability to spot and ignore it

Assignment for next class is to help us flesh out the two sides of this debate

- Submit two pieces of evidence and an explanation of each on Canvas

1. It IS rational, e.g. the benefits outweigh the costs

2. It is NOT rational, e.g. the costs outweigh the benefits
