Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions AND publish the optional dataset (V-Dem-2023-polyarchy_all_countries.xlsx)

2. Readings: V-Dem Methodology
    - "2.1 Principles – Measured by V-Dem’s Democracy Indices" p4, on how the V-Dem project identifies the flavors of democracy
    - "3.2 Coding Types and the V-Dem Codebook" p11, on the different types of measure included in V-Dem: facts and evaluations
    - "3.4 Country Expert Recruitment" p13-14, experts used for evaluation data
    - "4. Measurement" p21-26 on the lengths implemented to quantify and minimize error

3. Readings: V-Dem Codebook
    - The components of the electoral democracy index are on p41
    - Each indicator is described in Section 3 of the codebook p61-243

3. Data: V-Dem-USA-1789-2023-Electoral_Democracy_Index.xlsx

4. Note: I also posted the polyarchy scores for all countries in most recent year (2023) as context for thinking about the US scores

<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

<br>

*Split class into new groups! (3 each)*

- Time to work with new people!

## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

The target of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

::: notes

**With a week of work on our first data project under your belt, any questions on the target assignment?**

## Comparing Democracy Indices {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png"}

![](Images/04_1-VDem_electoral_index_components.png){.absolute right=0}

::: notes

Our first job today is to analyze the key definitional choices made by the V-Dem team in constructing their electoral democracy index

- So, I have two interrelated questions:

1. How different are these two definitions of democracy?

2. How SUBSTANTIVE are these differences?

<br>

GROUPS, share your Canvas answers with each other and get ready to report back to the class!

<br>

**FIRST, how different are the definitions?**

- **Do any of the V-Dem categories overlap most directly with the Polity5 components?**

- (Some conceptual overlap with the "elected officials" index and the "freedom of association" index)

<br>

**SECOND, how BIG are the differences?**

<br>

**On a conceptual level, do you have any concerns with the 40 variables included here? e.g. variables you don't think are related to democracy?**

- **Are we clear on what each one measures?**

<br>

SLIDE: Ok, let's start analyzing the data!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Make a line plot of v2x_polyarchy for the US across time**

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.height=6.5}
d |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = v2x_polyarchy)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Electoral Democracy Index",
       caption = "Source: V-Dem (2024)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1785, 2025, 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, .1), limits = c(0,1))
```

:::

::: notes

Let's visualize the data!

- v2x_polyarchy is the variable name for the electoral democracy index

- It is an interval variable running from low (0) to high (1)

- An interval scale is one where there is order and the difference between two values is meaningful.

- In other words, a move from .3 to .4 on this index is the same magnitude of change as a move from .6 to .7

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**Groups, discuss the variation here and report back. What do we see?**

- 1860 Civil War?

- 1895 jump in score?

- 1921 women's suffrage?

- 1965 voting rights act?

- 2016 Trump gets elected?

<br>

On Canvas I shared a second data file with you: V-Dem-2023-polyarchy_all_countries.xlsx

- Open that file and scan through the current placement of countries on the V-Dem electoral democracy index

- Get ready to report back how this context changes your view of American democracy over time

::: notes

Let's track down the key sources of variation in the US experience of democracy

- Clearly, we have no measured variation in the institutional design of US office holding as measured by V-Dem so we'll set that one aside

- *YOU divy out the line plots to the groups BUT SKIP v2x_elecoff (4 categories, 4 groups)*

<br>

Groups, make a line plot and analyze the results for us

- Get ready to report back your findings!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

::: notes

Indicates the US has strengths in free association, access to information and freedom of expression 

- Although a small divot in free expression during the Trump administration

<br>

Substantial growth in the suffrage measure over time

- 15th Amendment in 1870 (voting rights cannot be denied or abridged based on "Race, color, or previous condition of servitude")

- 19th Amendment in 1920 (Sex)

- 24th Amendment in 1964 ("[F]ailure to pay any poll tax or other tax" for federal elections)

- VRA in 1965

- 26th Amendment in 1971 (lowers voting age to 18)

<br>

LOTS of variation in "Free and Fair elections" index

- US didn't widely adopt the secret ballot for federal elections until the 1890s

- Per wikipedia: Before the final years of the 19th century, partisan newspapers printed filled-out ballots, which party workers distributed on election day so voters could drop them directly into the boxes.

- (SLIDE: Unpack all measures with variation in "Free and Fair elections" index)

::: notes

Generally speaking, the story since the Civil War has been one of elections getting cleaner over time!

- Adopting a secret ballot, less vote buying, less political violence around elections

<br>

SLIDE: Evaluate the methodology

:::



## Evaluating a Measure of Democracy {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

A useful argument about the quality of any measure of democracy should consider:

1. The definition of democracy being used,

2. The source(s) of the data being analyzed, 

3. The instrument(s) being applied to that data, and 

4. The measurement process being used.

::: notes

All of our work so far has been built on the assumption that the V-Dem electoral democracy index is highly precise and reliable

- HOWEVER, we wouldn't want to provide V-Dem's answers to our big questions unless we've grappled with the strengths and weaknesses in the work.

<br>

Groups, review the Canvas submissions and let's discuss the strengths and weaknesses of how V-Dem creates this index of democracy

- *ON BOARD: Two Lists*

<br>

Strengths:

- 

Weaknesses:

- 

<br>

**Bottom line, how much uncertainty do we believe surrounds each score on the index and its component measures in a given year?**

Same exercise as last week.

- A reading that proposes a set of threats to American democracy, and

- An exercise in using the instruments for measuring democracy designed by the research team

<br>

For this one I will ask you to focus on the five categories they include under the broad index of electoral democracy.

- Your job will be to describe how you think each index has changed, or is likely to change

- Think of this like forecasting a rising score, a falling score or a score that stays the same.
