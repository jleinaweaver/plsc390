Let me open today by giving you a "peek" behind the proverbial curtain

- This article was published last year in basically the most prestigius poli sci journal and given its subject I had to grab it for this class. 

<br>

Let me be clear, I did NOT know Grumbach's main conclusion when I picked it. 

- Reading the article I got a terrible pit in my stomach. 

- I very badly want my classrooms to be a place where students feel free to explore and contest ALL political ideas. 

- I do not aim to convince you of one way or the other, but to learn to think deeply and critically about all of them. 

<br>

The argument in this paper is both exhilarating and terrifying

- I'm not trying to take a stand on what should be your favorite baseball team

- HOWEVER, if we want to be scientists then we have to follow the data even if the conclusions make us uncomfortable

<br>

SLIDE: The key outcome to explain

## Grumbach's (2023) Outcome {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023_fig2.png)

::: notes

Grumbach develops a measure of state-level American democracy and uses it to identify a decline in the health of American democracy at the state level across the country over the last 20 years

- Lighter colors = Bad!

<br>

Grumbach then seeks to explain WHY we see this decline in these states

- He tests theories related to party competition, polarization and party organization

- SLIDE: And concludes...

:::



## Grumbach's (2023) Conclusions {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023_fig5.png)

::: notes

You cannot explain this variation by focusing on competition or polarization

- In fact, increasing party competition is associated with a small, positive effect on democracy!

<br>

The bottom line:

1. "Republican control of state government reduces democratic performance"

2. "The magnitude of democratic contraction from Republican control is surprisingly large..."

<br>

I have ZERO objection if your personal mission today is to undermine this conclusion

- Hell, I'll help you do it if you can identify some specific weaknesses!

### Evaluating Sub-National American Democracy

<br>

Grumbach, J. M. (2023). Laboratories of Democratic Backsliding. *American Political Science Review*, 117(3), 967–984.

- Submit to Canvas your reaction to the Grumbach (2023) article. Were you convinced by his conclusions? Why or why not?

::: notes

There's so much we could dig into for this, but let's see where you guys want to go based on the Canvas responses

<br>

*We need to evaluate (SLIDES follow for each):*

1. Grumbach's definition of democracy

2. His measurement of the outcome variable: the State Democracy Index
    - Intuition of a factor analysis
    - Factor analysis of 51 indicators
    - Figure 1 showing slope of effect for each indicator

3. His theoretical argument (e.g. why should Republican control threaten democratic performance?)

4. His results
    - Intuition of a difference in differences analysis
    - Table 1 shows its not polarization or party competition (which has actually has a small positive effect!)
    - Table 2 shows its not changing racial demographics

### Defining Democracy

- Primary: Electoral democracy (Dahl's "polyarchy")

- Secondary: Liberal democracy

- Secondary: Egalitarian democracy

::: notes

**Talk me through your evaluation of Grumbach's definition of democracy at the sub-national level.**

<br>

p968-970

- Primary focus: Electoral democracy (a la Dahl's "polyarchy")

- Robustness Extension 1: Liberal democracy (e.g. civil rights and liberties)

- Robustness Extension 2: Egalitarian democracy (e.g. equality of rights)

<br>

SLIDE: Moving from Grumbach's concept of democracy to his measure of democracy requires a quick detour into the world of factor analysis for a moment.

## {background-image="Images/08_1-Fishing.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Imagine you work on a fishing boat with limited storage space for your catch

- You haul in a load of fish and would like to keep the "big" ones and throw back the "small" ones

- You have a good sense of this just by looking at them, but you want to maximize your earnings so you need to get more precise than just eye-balling

<br>

The problem is that there are a bunch of ways to measure a fish 

- You could look at weight, the length from mouth to tail, the height, the distance from the fin to the tail

- BUT no single way is "best" for all fish

<br>

Factor analysis is an approach where you analyze all of these measures together

- You assume all of them jointly describe "bigness" so you look to see how the measures correlate

- Ideally, you want to produce a size score that correlates with all of the measures

- In other words, if I told you the size score for a single fish you'd have a good sense of how that fish rates in terms of weight, length, fin size, etc.

<br>

**Big picture, does that make sense?**

- Factor analysis is a method for reducing a large number of related variables into a smaller set of factors

- In short, it extracts the maximum common variance from all the variables and converts them into a single score

- Built on key assumptions such as linearity, absence of multicollinearity, inclusion of relevant variables, and a true correlation between variables and factors.

<br>

SLIDE: So now let's talk about Grumbach's democracy index

:::



## The State Democracy Index {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023_fig1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Grumbach (2023) uses a Bayesian factor analysis of these 51 indicator variables to construct his index of democracy

- The variables are listed in Grumbach2022-Variables_list.xlsx on Canvas for next class

- Remember, to use FA he is arguing that each of these variables measure some distinct part of his concept of democracy

<br>

Figure 1 shows the one of the results of the FA process

- It tells us HOW each variable impacts democracy (e.g. the slope of effect for each indicator)

- Positive values means states with more of this score higher on the democracy index

- Negative values mean states with more of this score lower on the democracy index

<br>

**Strengths and weaknesses of this measure?**

<br>

- **Are you convinced all 51 of these indicators measure Grumbach's core democracy concept? Why or why not?**

- **Any surprises in the directions of the effects?**

- Wealthy GOP elite incentivized to restrict the electorate away from those with different "class interests"

- GOP base incentivized to restrict the electorate to protect their racial and partisan identity

- Different reasons, but both push to restrict democracy
:::


::: notes

The paper considers and tests four models, however only this one is consistent with the evidence

- So, let's focus on it

<br>

**What are the assumptions in this model? (p975)**

- **Why should Republican control threaten democratic performance?**

<br>

- GOP at the elite level is a coalition of the very wealthy (wealthy individuals and large firms) incentivized to limit the electorate away from voters with different "class interests" (p975)

- GOP base "less interested" in this economic agenda BUT do oppose electorate expansion in a diversifying country rooted in protecting their racial and partisan identity

- Those two dynamics reinforce each other; both push to restrict democracy but for different reasons

<br>

Remember, models are like maps

- Simplifications of reality, not true or false, but useful or not

<br>

**Strengths and weaknesses of this model as a map of understanding the level of democracy in the US states?**

<br>

![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023_tab1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Grumbach then runs a series of difference-in-differences analyses (think regressions basically) to test his models against the data

<br>

The conclusions here are stark:

1. It's not party competition

    - Effect is not significant across all model specifications
    
    - Arguably, party competition has a small positive effect on democracy performance!

2. It's not polarization

    - Essentially indistinguishable from zero effect

3. It's not an interaction of other stresses and Republican control

<br>

**It IS Republican control**

- Coefficients are large, negative and significant across all model specifications

- Operationalized as a dummy variable (p976): "Republican control is a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if the state is under unified Republican control and 0 if the state is under Democratic or divided control."
    - FOOTNOTE 19: "Future research can disaggregate partisan control of each legislative chamber, the governorship, and their interactions to study more granular effects of partisan control."

- SLIDE: And the effect gets stronger over time

<br>

![](Images/08_1-Grumbach2023_fig5.png)

::: notes

According to this data, the longer the Republicans control of the state lasts the more negative the effects!

<br>

Bottom line time!

- **Are you convinced by the argument? Why or why not?**

<br>

**If you are convinced, what do we do with this information?**

- **What does this suggest about the health of American democracy at the state level?**

### Let's explore Grumbach's data

- Get hands on with the data and the variable list and start exploring!

::: notes

Make sure you can open and understand the two datasets using the variable list

- Start exploring!

::: notes

*Save for if it comes up*

<br>

It's not changes in black or hispanic population size or growth

- Again, even when controlling for these changes, it is the Republican party's control that is associated with large declines in democracy
