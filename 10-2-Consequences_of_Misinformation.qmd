What are our takeaways from the work last class?

<br>

**How do we define misinformation?**

- (Confidently held beliefs that run counter to the best available evidence / expert consensus)

- (The level of the problem appears to be dependent on the level of expert consensus x the amount of evidence)

<br>

**Give me an example of misinformation in the world today that clearly meets these definitions.**

<br>

Today I want us to explore evidence that speaks to the magnitude of this problem

- SLIDE: Let's start with the Kavanagh and Rich (2018) chapter

:::



## Kavanagh and Rich (2018) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Truth Decay in Four Trends:**

::: {.incremental}

1. Increasing disagreement about facts and analytical interpretations of facts and data

2. A blurring of the line between opinion and fact

3. The increasing relative volume, and resulting influence, of opinion and personal experience over fact

4. Declining trust in formerly respected sources of factual information

:::

::: notes

The Kavanagh and Rich book is the result of a research project hosted by the Rand Corporation

- Rand is a think-tank that historically has focused on security and military issues for the US government

<br>

This book is titled Truth Decay

- The big picture aim of the project is to "Restore the Role of Facts and Analysis in Public Life"

- The authors define truth decay as four trends they see operating in America today

- REVEAL x 4

<br>

**How does "truth decay" compare to our definitions of "misinformation" from the literature?**

- **How similar? How different?**

<br>

SLIDE: The consequences

:::



## Kavanagh and Rich (2018) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Consequences of Truth Decay**

1. Erosion of Civil Discourse (192-199)

2. Political Paralysis (199-207)

3. Alienation and Disengagement (207-216)

4. Policy Uncertainty (216-221)

:::

::: notes

Chapter 5 lays out these four consequences of truth decay

<br>

GROUPS (x4)

- *Assign one consequence to each group*

<br>

GROUPS, I'd like you to evaluate two aspects of your assigned consequence

- SLIDE

:::



## Kavanagh and Rich (2018) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**The Consequences of Truth Decay**

- Erosion of Civil Discourse, Political Paralysis, Alienation and Disengagement, Policy Uncertainty

**Are you convinced:**

1. This is **actually** happening?

2. It is caused **primarily** by misinformation?


::: notes

Get ready to report back your evaluations

- **Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**What stands out here as the most pressing problem for America today?**

<br>

**To what degree do we believe that addressing the misinformation problem will correct these problems?**

<br>

The other two pieces of evidence on isinformation I want us to consider today is survey data

::: notes

Thus far this semester we have focused our evaluations of methodologies on data projects all aiming to measure democracy using expert analyses

- For each of those we focused on the challenge of moving from a concept to a measurement

- Included: Conceptual definitions, operationalizations, instrumentation and the process of actual measurement

<br>

Surveys add EVEN MORE complications!

- Who gets asked, how they get asked, the order of the questions, and on and on

<br>

Survey design is a deep specialty that we won't have the time to deeply explore

- HOWEVER, I think this piece by Gawiser and Witt offers very useful advice for being careful when reading survey results

<br>

**Any questions on the "20 Questions" proposed here to guide your analyses?**

<br>

*NOTES*

[LINK](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/20%20Questions%203rd%20edition_Web%20ver_2006.pdf)

1. Who did the poll?
2. Who paid for the poll and why was it done?
3. How many people were interviewed for the survey? 
4. How were those people chosen?
5. What area (nation, state, or region) or what group (teachers, lawyers, Democratic voters, etc.) were these people chosen from?
6. Are the results based on the answers of all the people interviewed?
7. Who should have been interviewed and was not? Or do response rates matter?
8. When was the poll done?
9. How were the interviews conducted?
10. What about polls on the Internet or World Wide Web?
11. What is the sampling error for the poll results?
12. Who’s on first?
13. What other kinds of factors can skew poll results?
14. What questions were asked?
15. In what order were the questions asked?
16. What about "push polls"?
17. What other polls have been done on this topic? Do they say the same thing? If they are different, why are they different?
18. What about exit polls?
19. What else needs to be included in the report of the poll?
20. So I've asked all the questions. The answers sound good. Should we report the results?

*YouGov survey (2023) on belief in conspiracy theories*

<br>

Everybody take a look at the YouGov survey on Americans' beliefs in conspiracy theories

- Get ready to report back on two things

1. How big is the problem?

2. How confident are you in these estimates of the size of the problem?

<br>

*DISCUSS*

- There is **SO MUCH GOOD STUFF** here to explore

<br>

GROUPS, dig into the results and call out results that catch your eye!

- **What stands out here as surprising?**

**How big is the misinformation problem measured by this survey?**

**Why or why not?**
