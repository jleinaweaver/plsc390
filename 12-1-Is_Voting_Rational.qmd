$$x = .25(100)$$

NO TALKING!

- If you can solve these you have the skills necessary to help me flesh out a simple model of voting

- Take a minute and solve these three equations

**Everybody get these?**

Let's use some simple math to explore the decision to vote as a formal model.

- Formal models are useful because they require precise thinking and a high clarity for your arguments.

<br>

Today I'll walk you through one particular model by Edlin, Gelman and Kaplan in 2007

- The article is titled "Voting as a Rational Choice: Why and How People Vote to Improve the Well-being of Others"

- SLIDE

::: {.incremental}

- Vote if the benefits > costs

- Vote = Benefits - Costs

- &#916;U = B − c

:::
:::

::: notes

We'll start by attacking this with a simple assumption

- REVEAL: We expect an individual to vote when the perceived benefits of voting exceed the costs of voting

- REVEAL: We can convert this into a simple algebraic formula

- REVEAL: We can then replace these words with symbols
    
    - U = utility or the total amount of satisfaction you get from doing something
    
    - The delta refers to the change in the variable (e.g. the change in utility) and we use this because these are probabilities not certainties
    
    - B = the benefits of voting
    
    - c = the costs of voting

<br>

So, our simple model here expects your utility of voting to be sensitive to both the benefits and the costs of voting

- If the benefits exceed the costs then you are more likely to vote

- **Fair place to start?**

<br>

**Per your arguments on Canvas, what are examples of the specific costs and benefits that fit into this formula?**

- Benefits = Pride? Policy specifics? etc.

- Costs = getting informed, going to poll, etc.

<br>

SLIDE: Add more to the formula

::: {.r-fit-text}

&#916;U = pB − c

::: notes

Here I am adding a new variable to the model

- The benefits assume that your preferred candidate wins, but that's not a guarantee.

- So, `p` is the probability that your vote is decisive in the election

- `p` is a probability running from 0 to 100%.

<br>

**Refresh my memory, what happens when you multiply a number, the benefits, by a proportion less than one?**

- (They get smaller!)

<br>

**So, let's say you have a 50% chance of casting the decisive vote, how much does this shrink your "benefits of voting" by?**

- Half!

- **Everybody understand this?**

<br>

**So, when should you vote according to this model?**

- Vote if ∆U > 0, Don’t vote if ∆U < 0.

- When the B is big.

- When the c is small.

- When the p is close to 1.

<br>

**Are we clear on all these?**

<br>

::: notes

Formal models are especially useful for helping us identify testable hypotheses. 

<br>

**Refresh my memory, what is the difference between a theory and a hypothesis?**

- **Is this (point to the model) a theory or a hypothesis?**

<br>

- Theory is a causal story that explains how the world works

- A hypothesis is a falsifiable, testable implication of the theory

- In other words, if the world works like this model, then the hypotheses are the specific things we should see in the world

<br>

So, this model is our theory of voting. Let’s figure out what the testable implications of it are.

<br>

**Focus on p, what state characteristics should tell us the size of this variable?**

- (Population size? So, big states should see smaller turnout.)

- (Anticipated closeness of the election? So, tight races should increase turnout.)

<br>

**Focus on B, what kinds of state characteristics should increase B?**

- (When the candidates are very different from each other; ideological distance)

<br>






- Draw simple, 1-d line. 5% income tax to 95% income tax. If the two candidates are distant from each other the likely policy made will mean much bigger stakes than if they are next to each other.

So, what state characteristics should increase the ideological distance between parties?
(Electoral rules. PR systems allow more parties to be competitive, so, PR systems should have greater turnout than FPTP.)

Focus on c, what kinds of state characteristics should reduce c?
(Postal voting, Weekend voting, Easier ballot construction, etc.
So, states with those features should have greater turnout.)

According to this model, should we vote in the US? 
- What value is p? 
- B? 
- c? 
In sum? (Don’t vote)

Is this a good model of voting or not?
(Maybe. On the one hand more people vote than it would probably argue should, but on the other hand, turnout in the US isn’t very high...)

Remember, we care about instrumental rationality (not procedural). This means an actor chooses whichever option she prefers and we don’t judge your preferences. So, what about actors who include societal benefits in their preferences? 

We may be looking at an incomplete conceptualization of B. Let’s expand our view of B.
ON BOARD: B = B_self + N * B_soc

B_self are individual benefits, what we talked about before. 
- How big are these? (Not huge, depend on ideological distance, etc.)

B_soc are the benefits to society “as perceived by the person making the decision whether to vote.”
- What do we think are societal benefits? What are plausible things a voter might believe about what will happen if their preferred candidate wins?
(Leader X will lower taxes, lower taxes makes everybody personally wealthier, more money in the economy means more jobs are created...)
(Leader Y will increase taxes to pay for job training for the unemployed, better trained workers get better jobs and get off of welfare...)
(Leader Z will be more respected globally which will translate to better trade deals and more international cooperation on security issues...)

- How big are these? 
(Hard to quantify, probably tiny because they are somewhat uncertain.)

N is the population.
- We multiply those societal benefits by the population.

How big does this make B in the US case? (Huge, even if the societal benefit is tiny.)
- So, even a small benefit seen going to society becomes a huge incentive to vote if the population is huge.

Is everyone clear on that?

Any problems with this version of the model? Be critical.
(Sure, I value the benefits I get way more than the benefits that go to society as a whole.)
(People can be selfish!)

ON BOARD: B = B_self + α * N * B_soc

α is discounting factor b/c “benefits to others are less important than benefits to self”. 
- A voter is selfish at α = 0 and social if α > 0. Most people between 0 and 1.

What does this do to the effect of population size?
(If very selfish than even a huge population doesn’t change the calculus much, but very selfless will see a big benefit even if population is small.)

ON BOARD: ∆U = p * (B_self + α * N * B_soc) − c

Ok, what does this modification do to our expectations re: voting? Hypotheses?
(1. The benefits may be much bigger than previously assumed. 
2. Selfish voter sees odds of being pivotal shrink as N grows. 
3. Social voter sees B_soc grow as N grows (offsetting reduced likelihood of being pivotal).

So, is it rational to vote?
It certainly can be...

Which model do we prefer?
