## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

The target of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

**Two weeks into our review of competing academic measures of democracy, any questions on the target assignment?**

Our first job today is to analyze the key definitional choices made by the Freedom House team in constructing their index

- Same questions as last week: 1) How different is this definition, and 2) how substantive are these differences?

- GROUPS, share your Canvas answers with each other and get ready to report back to the class!

## Working with FH Data {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}

::: {.incremental}

1. Create a new variable: 
    - Year = Edition - 1

2. Focus on the "Scores" and NOT the "Ratings
    - Political Rights: 0 - 40
    - Civil Liberties: 0 - 60
    - Total: 0 - 100

:::

::::

::: notes

REVEAL: FH datasets typically organized by "Edition" which is the year the report was released

- Actual year being coded was essentially always the year before

- So, create a new "Year" variable in your spreadsheet

<br>

REVEAL: From the start of the project until about 2000 the primary measurement outputs of the "Freedom in the World" project were the PR and CL "ratings"

- Each converted the many, many underlying questions into variables on a 1-7 scale

- 1 representing the greatest degree of freedom, and 

- 7 the smallest degree of freedom

- The average of those two ratings thus determined the country's classification as either "free," "partly free" or "not free"

<br>

REVEAL x 3: The problems in this approach were many

1. Never throw away variation!
    - Our whole job is to explain variation!
    
    - Countries vary across a 0-100 score in FH, why would we prefer converting that down to 1-7? Why lose 14x the available variation??

2. WHATEVER process you choose for converting a 100 point scale down to a 7 point scale will have huge impacts on the results
    - Why introduce all that subjectivity into your measures?

**Any questions on this?**

::: notes

With your target reports in mind, let's talk visualizations for a moment

- **When you include a line plot like this in your report, should the y-axis focus in on the area with variation (left) or show the full possible range (right)?**

<br>

It depends on what you are trying to communicate to the reader!

- Statistics is both an art and a science

- BUT that doesn't mean you should aim to mislead!

<br>

Two aspects of this assignment lead me to prefer the full range

1. The FH Total score has a constrained range
    - There are no values outside 0 to 100 so placement within that range has meaning
    
    - High scores are likely democracies and low scores are probably not
    
2. The target of our reports are interested non-experts and we don't want to mislead them
    - A zoomed in version will lead someone who doesn't understand the FH measure to think American freedom has fallen off a proverbial cliff.
    
<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Optional: Use both!

- Start with the full range to introduce the measure and place the US on the broad spectrum of freedom

- THEN zoom in to have a more fine-grained discussion of variation in the measures

<br>

**Any questions on this?**

::: notes

So, the level of "freedom" in the US is declining.

- Is this primarily being driven by our a reduction in our political rights or civil liberties?

- Try putting both lines on the same plot!
    - Highlight "year", "PR" and "CL" then input the scatter with lines

- I know you can do this evaluation just looking at the spreadsheet, but this exercise is about communicating your findings to an audience, so make this plot!

<br>

**REVEAL: First of all, do we like a version of this plot with both lines on it or is this confusing?**

- (I'm on the fence with this choice...)

- (Maybe? better as separate plots with different y-axis ranges...)

<br>

**So, what does this tell us about American freedom?**

- **Is this more useful than a change in the top-line score? Why or why not?**

- *REPORT back and DISCUSS the finding*

<br>

SLIDE: Let's go one level deeper!

::: notes

This plot unpacks the three categories that combine to make the "Political Rights" index.

- Note that category B has 4 questions with 4 points each for a total of 16 possible points

- Categories A and C have 3 questions so top out at 12 points

<br>

Given how contested the definitions of "freedom", "political rights" and "civil liberties" are, I think this indicator level is where we actually start getting useful measures of American democracy

- **What do we learn from this about freedom in America over the recent past?**

- **Do we have a significant problem in terms of threats to our political rights or not?**

<br>

**Is everyone confident they could make this plot in Excel?**

In a sense, the Freedom House analyses of threats to American democracy can be summed up like this. 

- **Per your intuitions, is this an accurate diagnosis of the current pressing threats to American democracy? Why or why not?**

## Evaluating a Measure of Democracy {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

A useful argument about the quality of any measure of democracy should consider:

1. The definition of democracy being used,

2. The source(s) of the data being analyzed, 

3. The instrument(s) being applied to that data, and 

4. The measurement process being used.

::: notes

All of our work so far has been built on the assumption that the Freedom House measures are highly precise and reliable

- HOWEVER, we wouldn't want to provide Freedom House's answers to our big questions unless we've grappled with the strengths and weaknesses in the work.

<br>

Groups, review the Canvas submissions and let's discuss the strengths and weaknesses of how Freedom House creates their indicies of freedom

- *ON BOARD: Two Lists*

<br>

Strengths:

- 

Weaknesses:

- 

<br>

**Bottom line, how much uncertainty do we believe surrounds each score on the index and its component measures in a given year?**
