- **e.g. definition, sources, instrument and process**

Alright, let's use these V-Dem instruments to guide us in developing forecasts for the future.

<br>

Groups, touch base on your forecasts for a second Trump administration and get ready to report back

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS changes in specific indicators*
