## The Final Paper {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

What is one specific policy we could implement at the local, state or national level that would reduce the levels of misinformation, polarization or affective polarization in American society?

Make your argument in the style of an **op-ed of no more than 800 words (excluding the bibliography)** that you could submit to a newspaper or website interested in thoughtful, well researched analyses of the world we live in.

::: notes

**Questions on the final paper prompt or expected style?**
