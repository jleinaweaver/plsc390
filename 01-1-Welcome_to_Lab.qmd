## Course Grade {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text.png"}

```{r}
tibble(
  col1 = c("Participation", "Argument Paper 1", "Argument Paper 2", "Argument Paper 3", "Total"),
  col2 = c("", "(Feb 9)", "(Mar 22)", "(Final Exam)", ""),
  col3 = c(rep(25, 4), 100)
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = c("l", "c", "c"), col.names = c("", "", "%")) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 50) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = "11em") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = "7em") |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(c(0, 5), bold = TRUE, background = "#b3ccff")
```

::: notes
Course grade is pretty simple.

- Four equal pieces because being here and being engaged is as important to me as you learning to write convincing academic arguments.

<br>

Let's talk attendance and participation.

## The Attendance Cliff {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

::: notes
NOTE: This is an intro class, don't rush this!!!

<br>

My attendance policy is simple.

- The only way I can ensure everyone makes progress on the LOs is by being in class and doing the work.

- This means I have to make sure you are here!

<br>

To help encourage you I use an attendance cliff.

- Anyone with more than FOUR unexcused absences in the semester cannot earn higher than a ‘C’ in the course

- Regardless of grades earned on other assignments.

<br>

### Questions on this?

## Keep me in the loop! {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-office_space.jpg")
```

::: notes
What if you have an excused absence coming up?

- **It is your responsibility to email me BEFORE the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.**

- Easy peasy

<br>

This is also the place where I say to you, whatever is going on that might keep you out of class, please keep me in the loop. 

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

<br>

So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

### I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-participation-points.jpg")
```

::: notes
Ok, so I've got you coming to class now how do I make sure you're engaged?

- Participation points!

<br>

Basically, if you:

- Get to class on time,

- Have the materials you need to work, and

- Submit all daily required assignments BEFORE class,

You'll be good to go and these are easy free points.

<br>

Before most classes we will have a reading and a discussion question.

- You must submit your answer to that question on our Canvas discussion board BEFORE class begins to earn your participation point.

- The syllabus is marked for all class sessions that have a pre-class assignment

<br>

### Important note: Canvas will not tell you about discussion post requirements in your to do list. You have to keep track using the syllabus.

<br>

### Each participation point you lose will reduce your participation grade by 1/3 of a letter grade

### - e.g. A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, etc.

Your first job is to download the syllabus from Canvas and read it carefully.

It includes detail on everything you need to know.
- Assignment deadlines
- Readings
- Drury policies
- Office hours

ALSO, I can see who downloaded it, so don’t delay!

<br>

We'll be using Canvas for submitting assignments, posting to the discussions and accessing the class readings.

- Let me know if you have trouble accessing our materials on Canvas.

## Skeptical Knowing {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text.png"}

::: notes

So, how do we "follow" the election? How do we separate the useful information from the noise? Explore the advice about "skeptical knowing" in 

- Daily news coverage? (Kovach, B., & Rosenstiel, T. (2011). Chapter 3 The Way of Skeptical Knowing: The Tradecraft of Verification. In Blur: How to Know What’s True in the Age of Information Overload (p. 240). Bloomsbury Publishing. https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/blur-9781608193011)

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

Submit to Canvas:

1. A single piece of evidence (no overlap!) to support the argument that the US has a serious problem with "misinformation"

2. A single piece of evidence (no overlap!) to support the argument that the US has a serious problem with "polarization"

::: notes

Avoid overlap, first-come, first-served

Include APA citations with web links!
