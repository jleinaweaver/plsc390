Welcome all to this special topics class we are calling The Policy Lab!

- Today I want to talk you through why I created the class and what we'll be doing this semester

<br>

SLIDE: Let's take roll and introduce ourselves to each other before we dive into the agenda

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Name

2. Year in school

3. Major

4. Are you registered to vote?

5. What is your current plan to vote?
    - What time? Where?

:::

::: notes

*Introduce yourself*

<br>

**Your turn!**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, what are the big picture goals for this class?
:::




## Goal 1 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Tracking the 2024 Election**
:::

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-this_is_fine_meme.jpg")
```

::: notes
FIRST, I wanted an excuse to track the ins and outs of the current election

- My sense is that the stakes are insanely high and we'd be crazy not to get into it!

<br>

But I also wanted a place where we could explore this election in productive ways

- I don't want to get bogged down in media cycle nonsense

- I want a chance to focus on the the real-world policy implications of the election

<br>

We'll still keep an ear and an eye on all the chaos, that's fun too, but I want us to go deeper if we can.

:::



## Goal 2 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Evaluating the Health of American Democracy**
:::

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-elections_protest.webp")
```

::: notes
SECOND, I wanted an opportunity to think critically about the health of American democracy

<br>

Evaluating the health of our democracy requires us to answer questions like:

- What do we specifically mean by "democracy"?

- Why do some people argue we are a republic and not a democracy?

- How "democratic" are we currently? What are our strengths and weaknesses?

- What are the biggest threats to our "democracy"? How serious are they?

<br>

We'll focus the first half of our semester on many of these questions.

:::



## Goal 3 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Planning for the Future**
:::

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Protect-Democracy.png")
```

::: notes
FINALLY, I wanted the opportunity to explore what we can do to make positive changes in our community.

- What can we do to make a difference?

<br>

Put fancier, what policy options exist for us to improve the strength and resilience of our democracy at both the local and national levels?

<br>

SLIDE: We'll work on these three goals by splitting the semester essentially in half

:::



## Section 1 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

<br>

**Is democracy best thought of as a system designed to:**

- Constrain leaders with institutions?

- Promote free and fair elections?

- Guarantee personal freedoms?

- Promote egalitarian ideals?

::: notes

We'll spend the first half of the semester road-testing different measures of democracy

- *Read slide*

- Each one of these represents a coherent approach that emphasizes something important about the contested nature of democracy.

<br>

My plan is that we will have time to:

- Explore the design of each definition,

- Use each definition to evaluate the health of American democracy, and

- To identify which specific threats this definition suggests are most concerning.

<br>

Doing this will let us get hands-on with real-world data which always makes me happy!

- So, brush off your notes and get ready to do basic data analyses using a spreadsheet!

:::



## Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Contemporary Threats to American Democracy**

- Misinformation

- Issue Polarization

- Affective Polarization

:::

::: notes

In the second half of the semester we'll shift our focus to the cutting edge of political science research on new threats to American democracy.

<br>

Misinformation, the belief in things that aren't true, may be on the rise

- We need to dig into the literature on the why and how of this problem if we hope to solve it.

<br>

We also keep hearing about how polarized we are as a society and how that is definitely a bad thing.

- Again, we need to explore the literature and data on this problem so we can figure out what is going on and what is to be done.

<br>

SLIDE: That's the big picture plan, let's now talk details!

## May you live in interesting times... {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text.png" .center}

::: notes

**Has anybody heard of this "ancient Chinese" curse?**

- [Etymology link](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/may-you-live-in-interesting-times.html)

<br>

The story relayed by Western diplomats in the 1930s is that this is one of the most severe ancient curses you could throw at an enemy in China.

- "Interesting" being code for uncertain and highly dangerous

<br>

I should note that there isn't really any evidence the curse is actually Chinese or ancient at all.

- SLIDE: HOWEVER, Robert Kennedy famously invoked this idea in a speech in 1966

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-robert-kennedy-interesting-times.jpg")
```

::: notes

THIS is what I keep thinking of whenever I think about the current election.

<br>

We are living in incredibly "interesting" times and that can be both terrifying and exhilerating

- My hope is that we use this energy and these times to strengthen our society and our democratic roots

<br>

However, we cannot forget the stakes of what is happening right now

- SLIDE: With "the stakes" in mind, let's talk about your assignment for Thursday!

::: notes

As you can see in the syllabus and our Modules page you have a reading and an assignment for Thursday.

- To get your participation point you must submit the assignment BEFORE class begins

<br>

Everybody click on the assignment and let me know if you have any questions.

- *What are the stakes of the 2024 election? When you think about what stands to be gained or lost in this election, what do you think of? Bring evidence to class you can present and we can discuss. Submit an APA citation to your evidence and explain your answer (2-3 sentences).*

<br>

See you Thursday!

- Keep an ear out for good election material for us to discuss!
