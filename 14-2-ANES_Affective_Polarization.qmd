[Homans and McFadden 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/political-division-friends-family.html) 

- NYT on how politics is ending friendships and harming relationships

<br>

**Do the anecdotes in this story ring true in your life?**

- **Have you found family / friendships impacted in negative ways by politics?**

<br>

This data comes from 2022

- **Do you suspect these dynamics have persisted to today? Why or why not?**

<br>

Unfortunately, we don't have ANES data beyond 2020!

- SLIDE: But let's examine what we do have!

```

::: notes

Trends:

- Death penalty polarization begins to increase after 2000

- Trade and gun policy jumps after 2008

<br>

As we saw in the lit, little evidence of issue polarization (see Fiorina and Abrams (2008))

- Something appears to be changing recently

<br>

Today I want us to measure AP in the ANES data so let's dig in!
    
:::



## On average, how much does each party (VCF0303) like itself over time (VCF0004)? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

Let's start our work by examining how Democrats and Republicans like or dislike their own party.

- We already have the variables for party identification and time

- SLIDE: To this we need to add variables that measure how much the respondents "like" specific things

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

"We’d also like to get your feelings about some groups in American society. When I read the name of a group, we’d like you to rate it with what we call a feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees-100 degrees mean that you feel favorably and warm toward the group; ratings between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorably towards the group and that you don’t care too much for that group. If you don’t feel particularly warm or cold toward a group you would rate them at 50 degrees. If we come to a group you don’t know much about, just tell me and we’ll move on to the next one."

- The Democratic (VCF0218) & Republican (VCF0224) Parties

::: notes

VCF0218 and VCF0224 are feelings thermometer scales from 0 to 100

- The higher the number, the more the respondent likes that party

- VCF0218 measures how much the respondent likes the Democratic Party

- VCF0224 measures how much the respondent likes the Republican Party

<br>

**Questions on these measures?**

:::



## On average, how much does each party (VCF0303) like itself over time (VCF0004)? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### 1. On average, do Democrats like the Democratic Party (VCF0218) over time?

<br>

### 2. On average, do Republicans like the Republican Party (VCF0224) over time?


::: notes

My advice, calculate the average for each party focusing on themselves for each year in the dataset.

- Go!

::: notes

These plots include the IQR in each distribution (middle 50%)

- **What do we learn from broadening out our view beyond the average? Does this change anything?**

<br>

Interestingly, the parties respond to their own presidential candidates differently

- Democrats got more positive in 2008 with Obama's election

- Republicans got less positive in 2016 with Trump's election

- The lowest 25 percentile of Republicans drop BELOW '50'!

<br>

SLIDE: Ok, now it's time to measure affective polarization directly

## On average, how much does each party (VCF0303) like the "other" over time (VCF0004)? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

### 1. On average, do Democrats like the Republican Party (VCF0224) over time?

<br>

### 2. On average, do Republicans like the Democratic Party (VCF0218) over time?

::: notes

- Reverse your approach from last time

- Now you want to see how Republicans evaluate the Democratic Party and vice versa

- **Make sense?**

- Go!

::: notes

Good lord the partisan animosity exploded after 2008!

- **So what do we learn from this?**

<br>

Ok, now let's put these two pieces of information together

- Remember, polarization requires BOTH opposing viewpoints AND a more extreme set of scores

- So, disliking both parties isn't what we mean when we talk about AP

- SLIDE: AP requires a growing difference between self regard and other regard

Changes:

1. Let's examine the full scale of possible polarization (0-100)

2. I've added trend lines to identify the underlying trajectory of the increase in AP

    - I've also split the sample in two parts at 2000 to represent the apparent shift in trajectory that happens around that point.

3. And finally I've built a very simple model to project out the linear trend up to 2024

<br>

**Does this change your sense of the AP risk in America today?**

<br>

**Do we think the change over the last four years will end up looking linear or like something else? Maybe an exponential change?**

What is one specific policy we could implement at the local, state or national level that would reduce the levels of misinformation, polarization or affective polarization in American society?

Find us a policy proposal produced by a good quality think tank, non-profit or government agency that we could consider in class.

Submit:

1. A link to the policy,
2. An APA citation, and 
3. A brief explanation of it.
