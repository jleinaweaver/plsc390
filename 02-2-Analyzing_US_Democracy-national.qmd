Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Publish the Mike Lee website statement

<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

## For Today {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_color.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-ASSIGN.png)

::: notes

For today each of you road-tested your two measures of democracy on the US as a case study.

- **Big picture, how did this go?**

<br>

15 mins: Go back to your groups and debrief each other on your results

- What were the results of applying your measures to the US case?

- What kinds of evidence did you select?

- What big threats did your measure lead you to?

<br>

SLIDE: Let's report back and see where we stand.

:::



## Is the US currently a democracy? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

<br>

### - Yes or No?

::: notes

Alright groups, let's focus on the results of applying your nominal measures.

<br>

**Per your instrument, is the US currently a democracy? Why or why not?**

<br>

- *DISCUSS any differences in results across groups*

- *DISCUSS any differences in instruments across groups*

<br>

**Per your evidence, how confident are you about your rating?**

- **Is your evidence high quality enough? How do we tell?**

:::



## How democratic is the US currently? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

<br>

1. "No democracy at all"

2. "Very little democracy"

3. "Some democracy"

4. "A great deal of democracy"

::: notes

Alright groups, let's focus on the results of applying your ordinal measures.

<br>

**Per your instrument, how democratic is the US currently?**

- **What are the biggest drivers of this score?**

<br>

- *DISCUSS any differences in results across groups*

- *DISCUSS any differences in instruments across groups*

<br>

**Per your evidence, how confident are you about your rating?**

- **Is your evidence high quality enough? How do we tell?**

:::



## Per your work, what are the biggest current threats to American democracy? {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

::: notes

**Alright, based on your work what are the specific, current threats to American democracy?**

- **The threats should be derived from the specifics of your instrument!**

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

*IF TIME REMAINS*

SLIDE: Ok, now it's time for a tangent into the real world implications of our research this week.

**Who here has encountered the "we're a republic, not a democracy" argument?**

<br>

On Canvas I have shared a statement by Senator Mike Lee of Utah making this argument.

- Everybody read it and then we can talk.

<br>

**Based on your work this week operationalizing and measuring democracy, evaluate this argument for me. Is it convincing?**

<br>

- (SLIDE with two of Lee's tweets on this and your points)

::: notes

FIRST, the argument pretends "democracy" has a single, VERY limited definition

- Specifically, this defines democracy ONLY as in its *direct* form meaning everyone votes on everything and 51% can do anything to anyone

- Funnily enough, he gives the whole thing away with the second paragraph when points out that only the straw man version of democracy enables him to make his argument

<br>

**From your work on democracy this week, how many possible principles of democracy does this ignore?**

- **And how many countries in the world would meet his straw man definition of democracy?** 

- (None?)

<br>

SECOND, this doesn't really define "republic" very clearly at all

- "Power is not found in mere majorities, but in carefully balanced power."

- "Democratic principles have proven essential to those goals, but only as part of a system of checks and balances among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal government, as well as between the federal government and the states."

<br>

The problem here for Lee is twofold

1. Republic is a categorical label we don't really use anymore because it isn't very useful for describing the world as it currently exists

- In the era of our forefathers, a republic was meant to tell you we didn't have a monarch

- In other words, a republican form of government exists to the benefit of its people and not to the benefit of its king

2. If we extend "republic" to mean "representative government", as Lee does in this argument, than republic is just a synonym for some principles of democracy (checks and balances)

- In that case he has simply argued that America simply has some principles of democracy and not others

- A much less impressive conclusion, no?

::: notes

Here's another one I hear from time to time

- **Based on our work this week, evaluate this argument for me. Is it convincing?**

<br>

FIRST, our founding fathers didn't agree on almost anything, stop pretending that they did

- BUT, they did mostly agree that we shouldn't have a king and hence the repeated use of the word "republic"!

<br>

SECOND, there are lots of rights we enjoy as citizens that cannot be found with a keyword search through the constitution

- the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to keep personal matters private and to make important decisions about one’s health care

- see the 9th amendment and unenumerated rights

<br>

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the key here is that our founding documents are FULL of the many elements of democracy we have been exploring in class today!

- The word "democracy" isn't magic, it is a label covering all these different principles

<br>

**Does everyone see why I described this as a rhetorical strategy and not a high quality argument?**

<br>

Bottom line, I want you to see that your work this week coming to understand democracy as a contested concept will make you a better consumer of the news and political rhetoric!

## Next Week: The Polity Project {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_color.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-polity1800.jpg")
```

::: notes

Next week we explore our first academic research project that aims to measure democracy

- The Polity Project is the grand-daddy of the projects that aim to measure regime types across the world

- It has been working to measure the world since the 1970s

<br>

This is the line plot they include on their website showing the breakdown of countries by regime type across time

- e.g. how many democracies, anocracies and autocracies are there each year?

- “Anocracies” are regimes in the muddled middle, e.g. those with "odd combinations of democratic and autocratic authority patterns"

<br>

**What stands out to you in this plot?**

- (The number of countries is increasing across time)

- (Dictatorships spiked during the cold war)

- (Many dictatorships converted to democracies or anocracies after the fall of the USSR)

<br>

SLIDE: Our focus on Tuesday is to unpack this blue line: The institutionalized democracy index

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.incremental}
1. Evaluate the **source of the data** used by Polity5 to measure the level of "democracy" in a country

2. Evaluate the **process** used by Polity5 to **produce** and to **audit** its measures of "democracy"

3. What "flavor" of democracy discussed by Diamond (1999) does this approach come closest to?

:::

::: notes

For next class you will need to:

- Review the Polity Codebook (selections in syllabus)

- Open and make sure you understand the structure of a data spreadsheet, and

- Submit a Canvas assignment before class

<br>

The assignment is meant to get you ready to analyze the Polity5 data in class

- REVEAL: To use the Polity measures you need to understand where their data comes from

- REVEAL: To use the Polity measures you need to understand how they turn data into specific measures of democracy

- REVEAL: To use the Polity measures you also need to understand what they are omitting from their definition of democracy

<br>

**Any questions on what I'm asking you to do?**
