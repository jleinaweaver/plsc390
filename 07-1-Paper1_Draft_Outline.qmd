Prep for Class

1. Check Canvas submissions

<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

:::



## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

The target of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

::: notes

Alright, this week we kick into high gear!

<br>

Over the last six weeks we have explore the contested concept of democracy

- We've considered competing definitions and how those definitions translate into different measures of the underlying ideas

- Now it is time to take on board everything you've learned and synthesize it for an interested, non-expert audience!

<br>

SLIDE: Assignment for today

::: notes

Here is the assignment I asked everyone to complete for today.

- My plan is that today we get and give each other feedback on these outlines in order to ensure that everyone is set up to write a really good first draft of the report

<br>

SLIDE: In pairs...

:::



## Give Feedback in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Does the outline make clear this paper has:

- a compelling thesis that addresses the assignment prompt?

- a clear macro structure?

- a clear meso structure?

- sufficient evidence to support each premise?

::: notes

PAIRS I want you to review each others' outlines and make sure everyone has completely addressed the assignment prompt for today

- Each outline should communicate ALL of these elements in a clear way

<br>

**Questions on this?**

- Go!

## Revise your Outline {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### 1. Add Critical Analysis

**Critical** arguments deepen our understanding of a topic by acknowledging the limitations of our logic / evidence and by addressing counter-arguments (per the rubric).

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Your report must include:

- Critical analysis of each of your premises, and

- Discussion of ALL FOUR data projects

:::

::: notes

Per the class writing rubric, a convincing academic argument MUST include critical analysis

- e.g. counter-arguments, evaluations of evidence, acknowledgements of limits in your argument

<br>

**BRAINSTORM: In what specific ways can you bring critical analysis into your reports?**

<br>

Each of your papers should deeply engage with the concept of democracy and the quality of the data we have studied this term.

- REVEAL

<br>

Everybody take a few minutes to revise their outlines to indicate WHERE AND HOW specifically you are adding critical analysis

<br>

### 2. Add Specific Visualization Plans

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Describe THREE visualizations you intend to include in your report as evidence for your premises
:::

::: notes

Next outline revision is to plan the visualizations you intend to include in your paper

- I think you'll find that describing the data visualizations you intend to make in specific detail will make the actual plotting MUCH easier

<br>

REVEAL: Describe THREE visualizations you intend to include in your report as evidence for your premises (you can do more, but start with three)

- Be specific!

- These must be connected to your argument, and

- You must specify the details (e.g. the data, the years, the type of plot, etc)

- Go!
