Prep for Class

1. Readings/Data
    - The Polity Codebook
    - PolityV-USA.xlsx
    - "So you need to explore some data.pdf"
    
<br>

Let's warm up with election news!

- *Open google news and search 'election'*

- **What's been going on since we last met? Anything noteworthy?**

- **Any changes in the stakes we discussed last class?**

<br>

Let's segue into the next portion of our class

- Last week we began to explore and evaluate democracy as a contested concept.

<br>

Over the next four weeks we will examine four research projects that each aim to define and measure democracy

- In class we will evaluate their designs, summarize their findings and attempt to extend their measures into the present day

<br>

SLIDE: All of this represents the baseline work you will need for your first paper assignment of the class

## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_v4_muted_text2.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

::: {.fragment}

Assume the recipient of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

:::

::: notes

On Oct 6th you will submit a report that takes the work we have completed in the first half of the class and uses it to make a convincing argument

- Your paper MUST utilize ALL four of the data projects we will explore in class

- This means your argument about American democracy must consider our institutions, elections, guaranteed rights and egalitarian ideals

<br>

REVEAL: Assumptions about the reader of your report

<br>

My advice to you is to use this as the lens for all of the work we will do over the next four weeks

- Be sure to use every minute of our class time together to prepare for this report

- Don't treat our work over the next four weeks as "simply for class"

- All of this work is to prepare you to write a compelling and convincing argument paper

<br>

GROUPS: Examine the design of the "institutional democracy" index (Polity V project). Is this valid and reliable data? How is it gathered? How is it audited?

- Which "flavor" of democracy does Polity's work focus on?

- "The unit of analysis is the “polity.” Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines a “polity” as a “political or governmental organization; a society or institution with an organized government; state; body politic” (p1).









EXCEL: Explore the polity data for the US over time; what do we learn from this? Where is the key variation? How well does this cover "democracy" as a concept (week 2 work)? Hitting all the parts we think are important? How does this help us think about the stakes of the election?

APPLY: How could we use visualizations and/or descriptive stats to summarize Polity's measurements of American democracy?

::: notes

"The Polity Project has, since the 1970s, produced an additive, ten-point scale of institutionalized democracy that includes measures focused on competitiveness of political participation (1-3), the competitiveness of executive recruitment (1-2), the openness of executive recruitment (1), and constraints on the chief executive" (Vanhanen 2000, p252).
