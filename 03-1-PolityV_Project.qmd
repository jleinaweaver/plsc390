## Democracy as a Contested Concept {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue.png" .center}

<br>

"So serious is the conceptual disarray that more than 500 subtypes of democracy are identified in in [Collier and Levitsky's] review of some 150 (mostly recent) studies" (Diamond 1999, 7).

::: notes

Last week we began our examination of democracy as a contested concept

- You read Diamond (1999) that provided a sort-of overview of the big debates, and

- Developed and applied specific instruments of democracy in order to evaluate the United States

<br>

I think your work last week was crucial in both broadening and deepening your understandings of democracy as a concept AND the challenges of measuring anything.

- Over the next four weeks we will examine four well established research projects that each aim to define and measure democracy just like you did

- This exercise is meant to help us catch up with the cutting edge of these debates

<br>

SLIDE: At the end of this process I will ask you to write a research report on our work

:::




## Research Paper 1 (due Oct 6th) {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_color.png" .center}

<br>

Write a report **summarizing and evaluating** the current health of American democracy

<br>

::: {.fragment}

The target of your report:

- Is deeply interested in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy, 

- Is NOT a statistician, and 

- Is completely unfamiliar with projects we have explored.

:::

::: notes

*Read prompt*

<br>

The aim here is not to simply summarize the four research projects for the reader

- We are not writing an encyclopedia entry

<br>

The aim is to make an argument that answers an incredibly important question:

- How healthy is American democracy today?

<br>

The report can make whatever argument you want but you must draw on all four data projects to do it

- This means your argument about American democracy must consider our institutions, elections, guaranteed rights and egalitarian ideals

<br>

As a policy guy, I always think about who I am writing for when I develop an argument

- So, let me tell you about your target

- **REVEAL**

<br>

**Does the big picture of the assignment make sense?**

<br>

SLIDE: Alright, let's explore the Polity5 institutionalized democracy index!

::: notes

GROUPS: Compare and contrast the instruments for measuring democracy you created in Week 2 to the institutionalized democracy index created by Polity5.

- Share with each other what you submitted on Canvas!

- Get ready to report back your analyses

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- **Which groups' instruments are the closest to this index?**

- **Which groups' instruments are the most different?**

- **On a conceptual level, does this compare and contrast exercise raise any concerns for you about the Polity5 institutionalized democracy index? Why or why not?**

- **On a conceptual level, does this exercise give you confidence in any aspect of the Polity5 institutionalized democracy index? Why or why not?**

<br>

SLIDE: Ok, let's start analyzing the data!

**Review the `democ` score for the US across time**

```

:::

::::

::: notes

Ok, everybody take a few minutes to examine the DEMOC scores for the USA across time in the data spreadsheet.

- Use the codebook to ensure you understand all the codes used in the "democ" column

- Is there anything here we need to clean up before we start analyzing?

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

- `democ` is an additive 11 point scale running from 0-10

- Cases of “interregnum,” or anarchy (-77); Cases of “transition” (-88)

- US Constitution didn't start operating until March 1789 so it makes sense we don't have scores before this!

- Also, makes sense the Civil War is a tough period to measure!

<br>

SLIDE: Given our interest in analyzing the democ score during "normal" times, let's get rid of the interregnum and transition codes

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png"}

### 1. Create a new variable: `democ2`

```{r}
d |> 
  select(Country=country, Year=year, democ) |>
  mutate(
    democ2 = if_else(democ %in% c(-77, -88), NA_integer_, democ),
    excel_democ2 = if_else(democ %in% c(-77, -88), " ", as.character(democ))
  ) |>
  slice_head(n = 15) |>
  kbl(align = c("l", "c", "c")) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), font_size = 20)
```

::: {.r-fit-text}
**2. Make a line plot of the democ2 score across time**
:::

::: notes

Everybody create a new variable and call it `democ2`

- Replace each -77 and -88 with a missing data code (NA)

- IFF your working in Excel, leave those cells blank (NAs confuse Excel)

<br>

THEN, make a line plot of `democ2` across time 

- Get ready to report back on what kind of picture this data paints of American democracy since our founding

<br>

*Notes for Excel users:* Highlight the year column and the democ2 column then "insert", "scatter plot" chart, "scatter with straight lines"

- Not an Excel line plot because we want year on the x-axis

<br>

## {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_color.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618, fig.retina=3}
# basic plot
d |>
  mutate(
    democ = if_else(democ < 0, NA_integer_, democ)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = democ)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.3) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:10, limits = c(0, 10.1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1780, 2020, by = 10), limits = c(1789, 2020)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Democ Index (0 - 10)",
       title = "Variations in the US score of the institutionalized democracy index across time",
       caption = "Source: Polity5 (2022)")
```

::: notes

The most straightforward visualization is simply a line plot

- `democ` scores on the y-axis and years on the x-axis

<br>

For those who haven't taken data analysis, please note that any visualization you produce for class should be polished:

- A clear and informative title,

- Clear axis labels,

- Include the source of the data as a caption or figure description

<br>

**Questions on polishing a figure or making it ready for a professional audience?**

<br>

**Ok, talk me through what this shows us about America and democracy.**

- **Can we explain the peaks, valleys and gaps?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's add some context!

       caption = "Source: Polity5 (2022)") +
  annotate("text", x = 1905, y = c(5.5, 6.5), label = c("Non-Democracy", "Democracy"))
```

::: notes

The Polity5 team typically uses a score of "6" as a threshold necessary to call a country a democracy (e.g. as a nominal classification)

- Not everyone accepts this threshold, but that tends to be what the Polity team uses so we'll adopt it (for the moment)

<br>

**Based on this visualization and threshold, tell me about America as a democracy across time**

- **Is this nominal grouping consistent with your intuition about American democracy? Why or why not?**

<br>

Some details I can't ignore / make fit with this classification

- Building up to the Civil War the US population was in the 20s of millions and the slave population was climbing to nearly 4 million ([Hacker 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7716878/#:~:text=From%20that%20small%20beginning%2C%20the,the%20eighth%20census%20counted%203%2C953%2C760.))

- Until 1921 women, REPRESENTING MORE THAN HALF OUR POPULATION, COULDN'T VOTE!

- Until the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the right to vote for black people in this country was under serious threat

<br>

SLIDE: We need to unpack this variation to see what's driving it for the Polity team

**Alright, so according to Polity5 what drives the variation in American democracy over time?**

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each plot*

## Evaluating a Measure of Democracy {background-image="Images/background-white_house_graphic_blue_v2.png" .center}

<br>

A useful argument about the quality of any measure of democracy should consider:

1. The definition of democracy being used,

2. The source(s) of the data being analyzed, 

3. The instrument(s) being applied to that data, and 

4. The measurement process being used.

::: notes

All of our work so far has been built on the assumption that the Polity5 institutionalized democracy index is highly precise and reliable

- HOWEVER, we wouldn't want to provide Polity's answers to our big questions unless we've grappled with the strengths and weaknesses in the work.

<br>

Groups, review the Canvas submissions and let's discuss the strengths and weaknesses of how Polity5 measures democracy

- *ON BOARD: Two Lists*

<br>

Strengths:

- 

Weaknesses:

- 

<br>

**Bottom line, how much uncertainty do we believe surrounds each score on the index and its component measures in a given year?**

<br>

*Notes from Codebook*

- p3 to 11 describe the evolution of the polity process. It is not a fun read.

- Polity I (mid-1970s) hand-coded by one person
    - "The Polity I data were collected in the mid-1970s by a single coder, Erika Klee Gurr, who worked with increasingly refined versions of category definitions and coding guidelines" (5).
    
- Polity II converts Polity I to annual data and extends the dataset (started by Mark Lichbach, completed by Keith Jaggers)

- Polity III: In the mid 1990s a separate team of researchers (under the direction of Nils Petter Gleditsch) reviewed the historical cases focusing on polity score changes

- Polity IV: Big change in 1999 (see Appendix B)
    - New researchers were brought into the project and trained in established Polity coding procedures" (6).
    - New training procedures implemented and inter-coder reliability checks added (at least four coders per case; some overlap in case assignment across research teams)
    - These new procedures highlighted ambiguities in the processes and instruments
    
- Polity V standards implemented after 2000
    - "...includes a systematic re-examination of country codings over the previous five years and a review of cases that have raised concern and resulted in specific inquiries by data users" (9).
    - Starting in 2004 they also now produce a change log with each new update

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Linz (1990) The Perils of Presidentialism

2. Canvas Assignment: 
    - Update the Polity5 measures for 2024, and 
    
    - Make projections into the future!

:::

::: notes

Two tasks for Thursday:

<br>

FIRST, the Linz article is a famour and heavily cited piece that, I think, maps out the dangers of a presidential system.

- We definitely want to discuss this.

<br>

SECOND, update Polity and forecast the future!

- What do you think the codings will be in 2026 under a second Trump presidency? 

- What do you think the codings will be in 2026 under a first Harris presidency?

<br>
